SmartProperty CRM – Real Estate Engagement & Lead Conversion System

📘 Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
🔹 1. Introduction

The real estate industry deals with thousands of property inquiries every day from websites, social media, and offline events.
Currently, many companies manage these inquiries manually using emails and Excel sheets. This leads to:

Missed follow-ups

Delayed property visits

Slow deal closures

Lack of proper reporting

Solution → Salesforce CRM

Capture and store all leads in one system

Assign leads automatically to agents

Maintain property details in a structured way

Track customer visits and meetings

Manage deals from start to closure

Provide managers with real-time dashboards and reports
